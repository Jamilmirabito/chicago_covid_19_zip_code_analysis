## Background
Chicago is now in its second wave of the pandemic having approached a positivity rate of 15 percent at the start of November. With the massive uptick in positive cases, it’s important to understand which communities are most affected by the virus and how certain mitigation efforts may be working to reduce the city’s overall positivity rate through the coming weeks.

**Positivity rate** is the percentage of total tests administered in a given day that come back positive. This does not include rapid tests, or antibody tests.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate in a particular area **remain below 5 percent for at least 2 weeks before loosening restrictions.**
